Ideally, Congress would answer those questions in a law permitting states to require out-of-state vendors to collect sales taxes from their residents. But Congress hasn't done so despite repeated efforts in recent years, and lawmakers may be more likely to act after the court overturns its previous rulings than before."

Surprisingly, international maritime shipping emits levels of greenhouse gases that collectively are on par with Germany, which has the world's sixth-highest level of emissions. Driving the maritime emissions has been the sector's reliance on heavy fuel oil, a cheap but dirty-burning energy source that spews high levels of sulfur and other gases and particulates into the atmosphere. The industry, which moves at least four-fifths of the world's cargo, has been shifting from heavy fuel oil to liquid natural gas and other alternatives, and the International Maritime Organization will require all new ships added to fleets after 2025 to be 30% more efficient than those built under current construction designs."

But increasingly, the crisis in Los Angeles today is about a less visible (but more numerous) group of â€œeconomically homelessâ€ù people. These are people who have been driven onto the streets or into shelters by hard times, bad luck and Californiaâ€™s irresponsible failure to address its own housing needs.Consider Nadia, whose story has become typical. When she decided she had to end her abusive marriage, she knew it would be hard to find an affordable place to live with her three young children. With her husband, she had paid $2,000 a month for a three-bedroom condo in the San Fernando Valley, but prices were rising rapidly, and now two-bedroom apartments in the area were going for $2,400 â€” an impossible rent for a single parent who worked part time at Magic Mountain.For months she hunted while staying with family and friends. She qualified for a unit in a low-income housing project, but the waiting list was two years long. She obtained a federal Section 8 voucher to subsidize the rent in a market-rate apartment, but landlord after landlord refused to accept Section 8, or charged a rent that was too high to meet the federal governmentâ€™s unrealistically low â€œfair-market rentâ€ù limit.Nadia and her rambunctious young kids eventually wore out their welcome at the houses where they were staying. They found themselves left with little choice, with neither a place of their own nor a friend to fall back on. Last summer, they took refuge at San Fernando Valley Rescue Missionâ€™s shelter for homeless families.Top, Nadia reads a bedtime story to her son, Sebastian.

Right, Nadia's children in the dining room of the San Fernando Valley Rescue Missionâ€™s shelter for homeless families. (Los Angeles Times)Nadia and her children are among the economically homeless â€” men, women and, often enough, families, who find themselves without a place to live because of some kind of setback or immediate crisis: a divorce, a short-term illness, a loss of a job, an eviction. In many cities across the nation, these are not necessarily problems that would plunge a person into homelessness. But here they can. Why? Because of the shockingly high cost of housing in Los Angeles.For decades, Southern California â€” stuck in a low-density, single-family, not-in-my-backyard 20th century mindset â€” has failed to build enough housing to keep up with population growth and demand. Rents are at an all-time high. Stagnant incomes and a shortage of middle-class jobs mean there are more people struggling. The government safety net hasnâ€™t grown to catch all the people in need, nor has public sympathy always been on their side. In 2006, Los Angeles voters rejected a $1-billion bond to create 10,000 residential units for low-income and homeless people, thus exacerbating the housing shortage.Without a Home Theyâ€™re part of the Los Angeles streetscape, as familiar as the swaying palm trees and idling traffic, living under freeways, alongside riverbeds and on canyon hillsides. The mentally ill, the drug addicts, the economically disadvantaged, many with their life belongings in a backpack or shopping cart. In this ongoing series, Without a Home, The Times is examining the crisis of homelessness in our region. Full coverageToday, we are paying the price: The economically homeless are now estimated to make up more than half of L.A.â€™s unhoused â€” and it is their rising numbers that are fueling the unprecedented growth in that population. More than half of the people surveyed by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority last year said they were homeless because of an eviction, foreclosure, unemployment or â€œfinancial reasons.â€ùIn just six years, the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles County has increased 67%, from about $1,200 to $2,000, according to Zillowâ€™s Rent Index. The median household income during the same period increased only 23%, from $52,280 in 2011 to $64,300 in 2017.Today, 1 in 3 renters in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is considered â€œseverely rent burdened,â€ù meaning they spend at least half their income on housing. Los Angeles County is the most unaffordable region in the country for the poorest renters, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Department. To understand just how thin the line is between those with a place to live and those without, consider a study conducted by Zillow estimating that a rent increase of 5% in Los Angeles County would push 2,000 people into homelessness.Guadalupe Linares is an example of someone who teeters on the edge. She and her two children moved out of a $600-a-month illegally converted garage after a rat bit her son. But the one-bedroom she found cost twice as much, forcing her to take on long hours in multiple jobs, including cleaning houses and working in restaurants. Her 17-year-old daughter, Mariana, who had been thinking about a career in medicine, began missing school to help her mom clean houses from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. â€” which required her to transfer to an independent study program through the school district. She quickly learned that the program is full of kids putting their ambitions on hold while they work to help keep their families housed.This cannot be Los Angelesâ€™ future.Top, Guadalupe Linares prays with her children before bed.

Right, her 17-year-old daughter, Mariana, cleans a home for extra income. (Los Angeles Times)To end the housing shortage that is driving rents to unaffordable levels, Los Angeles County and its cities have to allow construction. A lot of it. Weâ€™re not talking, in this instance, about permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless people â€” that sort of housing (which includes access to social services and substance abuse and mental health treatment) is absolutely essential and is being built under Measure HHH in Los Angeles. The economically homeless need something else: affordable housing that offers below-market rents for low-income people. And regular market-rate housing as well that will increase the supply and help bring down rents for everyone.Since 1980, far fewer homes have been built than are needed to meet population growth in the county, according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments, and now the county has a deficit of nearly 1 million housing units. The vast majority of the 88 cities in the county are not adding enough market-rate and affordable housing to meet their fair share of the regionâ€™s growth.Sure, there are some legitimate excuses â€” land costs are high and environmental concerns have slowed development. But far too often, residents and elected officials act on their worst NIMBY instincts to block or restrict housing in the name of preventing traffic and density and protecting neighborhood character. One Torrance city councilman argued against building new homes, saying, â€œA city should be allowed to say weâ€™re full.â€ùNo â€” a city cannot say itâ€™s full. Too many people are clinging to an old vision of Southern California, when orange groves were plowed under for single-family subdivisions, wide avenues and freeways. Today, those ranch homes cost $1 million and more, the roads are clogged and working-class families can end up living in their cars. The region must build denser and taller to make space for the people who are already here. That doesnâ€™t require Dubai-style skyscrapers; it can mean more townhomes and four-story apartment buildings and high-rises near transit.A city cannot say itâ€™s full. The region must build denser and taller to make space for the people who are already here.â€ùThe state passed new laws last year to pressure cities to accommodate more housing and to streamline approvals in communities that have failed to keep up with population growth. California lawmakers also approved new funding for affordable housing and gave cities the authority to enact inclusionary zoning laws, which require that affordable units be built in market-rate housing developments. These are positive steps, but the state should adopt even more aggressive mandates if cities continue to throw up hurdles. In some cases, this will change the look, feel and character of cities. But thatâ€™s an inevitable result of population growth.Of course, it will take years to catch up on housing construction. In the meantime, rent hikes and evictions will continue. Thatâ€™s why policymakers must make the prevention of homelessness a cornerstone of their efforts. To that end, Los Angeles County plans to use Measure H funds to provide temporary rental assistance to help people on the brink of losing an apartment. Itâ€™s easier and cheaper to keep people in housing than to help them off the street after the fact.The county is also funding legal services to help poor renters fight eviction or to help them qualify for relocation assistance. Fewer than 1% of renters facing eviction have lawyers. Cities should also consider passing laws to require that landlords show â€œjust causeâ€ù to evict.The federal government has not done enough. HUD should significantly increase funding for the Section 8 voucher program in Los Angeles County, taking into account the high cost of housing here. Section 8 rental vouchers are pegged to HUDâ€™s â€œfair-market rents,â€ù which are often substantially less than actual market rents.Ultimately there has to be a recognition that every new apartment unit rejected is a family denied an affordable place to live. Just as Los Angeles voters were willing to say yes to higher taxes for homeless housing and services, they have to be willing to say yes to the housing construction in their neighborhoods. That will, over time, alleviate the shortage.Nadia and her children head back to their room at San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission. Los Angeles TimesNadia notes that it is not laziness or drinking or drug abuse thatâ€™s plunging so many people into homelessness. Itâ€™s the lack of affordable housing.After moving into the shelter she began working full time at a big insurance company doing data entry to save money for an apartment. Few co-workers knew she was living in a shelter.Nadia said, â€œNobodyâ€™s probably looking at me and saying, â€˜That woman is homeless.â€™ And Iâ€™m willing to bet a lot of them would be surprised.â€ù"
3,2,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/trump-administration-usda-swine-slaughter-rule-pigs-pork,4/19/18,High-speed pig slaughter will be disastrous for everyone involved | Deborah Berkowitz and Suzanne McMillan,"['Suzanne Mcmillan', 'Deborah Berkowitz']",4/17/18 0:00,"The Trump administration has proposed a radical change in food safety protection. Theyâ€™re misleadingly calling it the â€œModernization of swine slaughter inspection ruleâ€ù, but what it really does is roll back progress on protecting the public from serious and sometimes fatal diseases such as salmonella.The proposal drastically reduces the number of trained government food inspectors in pork plants, turns over food safety functions to untrained plant managers, and by allowing for an unlimited increase in slaughter line speeds, puts public health, worker safety and animal welfare at risk.Over the past few decades, the public has increasingly relied on the government to assure that, when it comes to food safety, the meat-packing industry wonâ€™t cut corners and endanger the health of our kids, our families and our communities. But the Trump administration has a different view of how much protection we all deserve.In other words, it allows the industry to police itself, like the fox guarding the proverbial hen (or hog) houseThe new proposal, which seeks to privatize the pork inspection system, would eliminate more than 140 food inspectors who now work in the nationâ€™s hog slaughter plants. Most of the remaining government inspectors would be removed from the production lines. In their place, the proposal allows a smaller number of company employees â€“ who are not required to receive relevant training â€“ to conduct fewer inspections. In other words, it allows the industry to police itself, like the fox guarding the proverbial hen (or hog) house.Of critical concern, the proposal removes any maximum limits on line speeds in pig slaughter plants. Pigs are already slaughtered at an astonishing rate of approximately 1,100 per hour. With this new rule, those speeds could reach up to 1,300 or even 1,500 pigs per hour. This will directly harm the health and safety of the nationâ€™s tens of thousands of meat-packing workers, make it harder for the limited number of meat inspectors to do their jobs, and jeopardize the welfare of more than 100 million pigs each year.Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekdayThe proposed increase in line speeds will result in higher injury rates for workers in our nationâ€™s packing houses. Scores of studies show that pork workers already face serious injury rates three times higher than the national average, and illness rates that are 17 times higher. The pork processing industry is one of the most dangerous for workers. The already breakneck line speeds, coupled with the forceful and repetitive nature of the jobs in meat-packing plants, lead to high rates of devastating injuries and illnesses.Faster lines and fewer inspectors wonâ€™t only have disastrous impacts on workers but also the animals they are tasked with processing. The removal of line speed caps has been shown to increase the chances for rough animal handling as employees feel the pressure to move pigs quickly through the slaughter. This increased speed can result in improper stunning that leads to animals being slaughtered while conscious. Fast line speeds may leave plant workers unable to detect signs of consciousness, or unable to stop the line in time to intervene.Facebook Twitter Pinterest â€˜Pigs are already slaughtered at an astonishing rate of approximately 1,100 per hour. Those speeds could reach up to 1,300 or even 1,500 pigs per hour.â€™ Photograph: Gary Calton for the ObserverReducing the number of inspectors at pig slaughter plants will make an already precarious animal welfare situation worse. More federal oversight, not less, is needed to ensure adequate animal handling, welfare, and compliance with federal law and regulations.Finally, the proposal will not even lead to safer food. A review of five plants that served as a pilot for this proposal reveals there were more food safety violations in these plants than in others. Additionally, a recent review by the USDAâ€™s own office of inspector general found that the agency failed to provide adequate oversight of those plants, and the pilot plants may have a higher potential for food safety risks.Adding insult to injury, the USDA issued this proposal without any final review of the impact on public health. The agency has not released all the data that supposedly supports the proposal, yet the public is only being given a few months to comment on this new system. How can stakeholders be expected to comment on a proposal without seeing the final scientific analysis on which it is based?A million tons of feces and an unbearable stench: life near industrial pig farms Read moreClearly, the real goal of this proposal is to allow the meat-packing industry to increase its profits. Itâ€™s all about lining the pockets of a few corporate executives â€“ at the expense of consumer health, worker safety and animal welfare.We urge the USDA to consider the millions of lives â€“ consumers, workers and animals â€“ they are placing at incredible peril. They should reject any increase in line speeds and withdraw the so-called modernization of swine slaughter inspection rule."

Trump is going down! According to a widely shared New Yorker article, published on Sunday, we are â€œentering the last phase of the Trump presidencyâ€ù. The article posits that the recent FBI raids on Michael Cohen, Trumpâ€™s lawyer and confidant, represent a significant turning point in the presidentâ€™s political fortunes.Itâ€™s a comforting prognosis. However, Iâ€™m afraid it is wildly optimistic. While the president is clearly rattled by the Cohen raid, Iâ€™m not sure we are anywhere near the end of Trumpâ€™s presidency. Quite the contrary. As long as he doesnâ€™t keel over from all the stress, I believe that not only will Trump see out his term, heâ€™s likely to win another one. Heck, he might even win a third term! He has flirted with the idea, after all. Last month, Trump praised the elimination of the two-term presidency limit in China and joked that maybe the United States will â€œgive that a shot some dayâ€ù. Indeed, a Trump dynasty, in which Ivanka eventually takes over the reins of power, isnâ€™t beyond the realm of possibility. If youâ€™re tempted to dismiss it as farfetched, Iâ€™d urge you to cast your mind back to 2016, when the idea of a Trump presidency seemed ludicrous. What we consider normal can change quickly.If Trumpâ€™s improbable ascent to power has demonstrated anything, itâ€™s that all bets are off. The New Yorker article bases its predictions of Trumpâ€™s demise on lessons from the past. But Trump defies precedent. By rights, after all, he should already have been ruined by any one of the many scandals he has weathered. It would seem that the man is made of Teflon; every new piece of breaking news slides right off him.Part of the reason Trump has proved so scandal-resistant is that he is a reality TV veteran; he understands how to spin facts into his preferred form of fiction. If something doesnâ€™t fit with Trumpâ€™s narrative it is dismissed as â€œfake newsâ€ù. Continually undermining trust in the media with such charges has proved a powerful strategy and authoritarian regimes around the world have taken note. Malaysia, for example, recently proposed laws that would make propagating â€œfake newsâ€ù a jailable offence; a move many fear is an attempt to quell dissent before the general election.If Trump has been adept at using fake news to his advantage in the past, itâ€™s nothing compared to what he might do in the future. Recent advances in AI-powered video manipulation technology mean tools are now available that enable you to literally put words in someoneâ€™s mouth, or make it look as if they are doing something they have never actually done. Some politicians have already warned they expect this technology to create such an abundance of â€œdeepfakesâ€ù that it â€œnearly drowns out actual factsâ€ù. Bearing this in mind, it no longer seems safe to assume that the truth will out and due process will take its course, no matter how dogged special counsel Robert Mueller may be.While fake news may be a useful weapon in Trumpâ€™s arsenal, however, the most powerful thing he has going for him are his very real accomplishments: namely, that he has slashed tax and helped make the rich richer. When Trump first took office, we heard a lot of reassuring things about the institutional safeguards that would stop him breaking the law and prevent the US from turning into an autocracy. But it seems that, as long as Trump keeps enriching the powerful, he has carte blanche to do as he likes. As has become increasingly clear, constitutional checks and balances are nothing compared to cheques and bank balances.Philosophy from the Western worldFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West â€“ rapper, designer, philosopher.

The rapper-slash-designer-slash-spouse of Kim Kardashian tweeted these words of wisdom a couple of days ago. Kanye is a philosopher now, you see. And not just on Twitter; according to a recent interview in the Hollywood Reporter, Kanye is currently writing a book of philosophy called Break the Simulation.

There is more Western wisdom to impart. In the same interview, for example, Kanye announces that he doesnâ€™t â€œwish to be number one any more, I wish to be waterâ€ù. But before you can begin to fully explore the depths of this, he hits you with another profundity. â€œI feel like Stephen Hawking,â€ù Kanye confesses. â€œHe changed his ideas and his theories all the time.

5,2,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/a-youtube-inspired-prank-ruined-my-daughters-life,4/19/18,A YouTube-inspired prank ruined my daughter's life,['Laurie Redmond'],4/17/18 0:00,"I had never heard of the â€œtricksterâ€ù Rick Lax. But an awful lot of people have. A video on one of his Facebook pages, entitled â€œHow to get your girlfriend to put her phone down,â€ù has an astounding 246m views. Apparently the video was made by a prankster pal of his named Ryan Hamilton, whose YouTube channel is at Hammy TV.In six scenarios, Hammyâ€™s girlfriend is on her phone â€“ and he sneaks up to blast her with an air horn. Hilarity ensues.Last year, my teenage daughter was blasted with an air horn to get her to put her phone down. She is now in pain every second of every day.Hereâ€™s how Cindy tells the story: dinner was an hour away. Cindy was at her friendâ€™s house, sitting alone at the kitchen table, chatting on her phone.Her friendâ€™s ex-stepfather entered the kitchen for a beer.Her friend and her friendâ€™s sister entered the room; the stepfather told them to leave. They did, giggling. Cindy wasnâ€™t paying attention, because she didnâ€™t know her life was about to be ruined.The stepfather told her, twice, to hang up. As she did, he blasted the air horn at her head.My daughter was blasted with an air horn to get her to put her phone down. She is now in pain every second of every day.The next day, Cindy didnâ€™t feel well, so she texted me from her English class. I took her home. She was never able to return to school. She was in eighth grade.We made the rounds of doctors, none of whom had heard of ear pain caused by acoustic trauma. We saw eight types of specialists who were either stumped or thought a little Tylenol would do.By the time Cindy received a formal diagnosis, we had learned about hyperacusis on the internet, and the news wasnâ€™t good.In truth, at the time, blasting an air horn at a child just seemed rude and dumb. We didnâ€™t have any idea it could cause catastrophic injuries.In most cases, too much noise causes hearing loss. In rare cases like Cindyâ€™s, it causes the opposite â€“ hyperacusis, or noise-induced pain. Noise is too loud for her, not too soft.Cindy has burning pain in her ears all the time. With all noise louder than ordinary conversation, she feels like she is being stabbed in the ear. Her ears ring.She looks perfectly healthy and normal, and yet everyday noises are injurious to her, as if she were allergic to light or air. Her condition is something modern medical science knows little about.I read the comments on the air horn video to find so many people lol-ing and lmao-ing at this clever prank that they find so funny. I googled my daughterâ€™s name, and now I am getting online ads for air horns. I feel helpless. Itâ€™s hard to see Cindy like this.Social media channels have a responsibility not to allow content that encourages violence against others. A friend flagged the air horn video on Facebook, but the autoreply said: â€œIt doesnâ€™t go against one of our specific Community Standards.â€ù Flagging some air horn videos on YouTube didnâ€™t even rate an autoreply.Last year, a YouTube prankster, an F-list celebrity named Jake Paul, was sued for wrecking someoneâ€™s ears with an air horn. He is the brother of Logan Paul, whom YouTube is now reluctantly censuring for repugnant content.YouTube and Facebook recently removed Tide Pod challenge videos so as not to encourage dangerous stunts. The Tide Pod challenge injures yourself, whereas an air horn prank injures someone else. I hope that the likes of YouTube and Facebook respond to the danger these videos pose.Up until then, letâ€™s not laugh at pranksters who blast each other with air horns for fun and profit. Maybe they themselves will end up with hearing loss, or tinnitus, or intractable ear pain where noise feels like a knife to the eardrum. Or, even worse, they may cause yet another person to have their hearing destroyed forever. Maybe then it will be time to stop laughing."

The Trump administration claims the recent assault was justified, but it has not laid out a rationale based on international law, says CFRâ€™s John Bellinger, legal advisor at the National Security Council and the State Department during the George W. Bush administration. This leaves the United States open to charges of acting lawlessly and inviting similar behavior by other countries, he says. The United Kingdom is the only government that has explicitly said its use of force comports with international law, citing humanitarian grounds.When the United States conducts a military strike such as this one, the White House looks to demonstrate that the use of force is permissible under both domestic and international law. How is the Trump administration framing these strikes from a legal standpoint?President Trump himself has not addressed the legal basis for either the strikes on Syria last year, on April 6, or those this past Friday, April 13, in any of his oral statements.The presidentâ€™s letters to Congress submitted pursuant to the War Powers Resolution within forty-eight hours after each of the two strikes, state that he acted in the â€œvital national security and foreign policy interests of the United Statesâ€ù and â€œpursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.â€ù He did not cite any congressional authorization for the use of force. In both letters, the president stated that he had ordered the actions â€œto degrade the Syrian militaryâ€™s ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks and to dissuade the Syrian regime from using or proliferating chemical weaponsâ€ù and to avert â€œa worsening of the regionâ€™s current humanitarian catastrophe.â€ùTrump administration officials have not cited any international law basis for the April 2017 or April 2018 strikes, and it would be difficult for them to do so. The UN Charter specifically prohibits a UN member state from using force against another member state except in self-defense or if authorized by the Security Council.In a statement to the Security Council on Saturday, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley defended the recent strike as â€œjustified, legitimate, and proportionate,â€ù which is carefully chosen, quasi-legal language suggesting that Trump administration lawyers concluded that the use of force could not be characterized as lawful under international law but was still appropriate on the basis of the specific facts in Syria. The Clinton administration adopted the same approach when it cited a number of factors as justifying U.S. air strikes against Serbia in Kosovo, without claiming that the use of force was legal.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowREUTERS/Eduardo MunozWhy does the legal rationale matter?It is important for Trump administration officials and lawyers to explain the legal basis or justification for any U.S. use of military force, including in Syria. As I said in testimony [PDF] before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last December regarding legal rules governing the use of force: â€œWhen the United States does not [explain the legal basis for its actions], it appears to act lawlessly and invites other countries to act without a legal basis or justification.â€ùThere looks to have been considerable debate within the administration over launching these strikes, ultimately deciding to go with a more restrained response. What do you make of the proportionality question?The April 13 strike was obviously quite limited. Itâ€™s not clear whether this was for a policy reason, i.e., to avoid provoking the Russians or Iranians, or for a legal reason, i.e., to allow the United States to claim that its use of force, even if not consistent with the UN Charter, at least met the customary international law requirement that any use of force be proportional to the threat.To what extent does the Trump administrationâ€™s legal rationale diverge from that for last yearâ€™s attack?The administration has relied on the same domestic law basis for both strikes, i.e., the presidentâ€™s inherent constitutional powers, rather than any congressional authorization.Although the administration has not (and probably could not) offer a clear international law basis for either strike, Ambassador Haleyâ€™s statement that the most recent strike was â€œjustified, legitimate, and proportionateâ€ù appears to be an effort, perhaps urged by administration lawyers, to provide an international law justification.How are the United Kingdom and France handling the legal questions?The United Kingdom appears to be the only one of the three governments who participated in last weekâ€™s strikes to state explicitly that its use of force was lawful under international law. The French government does not appear to have specifically addressed the legality of its use of force.On Saturday, the British government released an explanation of its legal position, stating that the international legal basis for the use of force was â€œhumanitarian intervention.â€ù The British statement said that Syriaâ€™s use of chemical weapons against its civilian population constituted a war crime and crime against humanity; that â€œthere was no practicable alternative to the truly exceptional use of force to degrade the Syrian regimeâ€™s chemical weapons capability and deter their further use by the Syrian regime in order to alleviate humanitarian sufferingâ€ù; and that the use of force was â€œnecessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable.â€ùUnder UK law, the British government may not use military force unless it has concluded that the use of force is lawful, including under international law. To participate in the strikes, the British government was therefore required to conclude specifically that its use of military force was permitted under international law, not simply justifiable. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in the world to recognize a legal right of humanitarian intervention. The British relied on this doctrine as the basis for their participation in the 1998â€“1999 Kosovo bombing campaign, and the [David] Cameron government said in 2013, at the time that Britain was considering intervention in Syria, that international law recognizes a right of humanitarian intervention.The U.S. government, like most other governments, has never accepted that international law recognizes a right of humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter does not authorize the use of force for humanitarian purposes, and successive U.S. administrations have concluded that recognizing such a right might create a precedent that could be abused by other countries.Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), have labeled these and past U.S. military strikes against Syria as illegal because Congress didnâ€™t authorize them. What are your thoughts on this debate?It is always preferableâ€”for both legal and political reasonsâ€”for a president to have congressional authorization for any use of force. That said, the president clearly has broad constitutional authority as chief executive and commander in chief to order the use of military force to advance important national interests.As I explained in my Senate testimony in December, presidents from both parties have deployed U.S. forces and ordered the use of military force without congressional authorization on several occasions. The Department of Justiceâ€™s Office of Legal Counsel has written numerous opinions, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, determining that the president has the power to commit troops and take military actions to protect a broad array of national interests, even in the absence of congressional authorization, including for the purpose of protecting regional stability, engaging in peacekeeping missions, and upholding UN Security Council resolutions.In this case, although there were certainly policy arguments for and against U.S. intervention in Syria, there was a compelling U.S. national interest in preventing and deterring Syria, as well as other governments, from using chemical weapons against its citizens.This interview has been edited and condensed."

The initial reaction by Israelis on the street was: Finally, there is an American President who stood by his wordâ€_a red line was indeed a red line.As the day progressed and it became clear the American attack was limited to three targetsâ€”targets that were empty and that the operation resulted in no Syrian casualtiesâ€”it became apparent to many the attack was no more than a show. In the aftermath of the U.S. attack it became clear that Assad would pay no more than a symbolic price for continuing to gas and murder more of his own people. The Russian threat of retaliation had worked and the U.S. and its allies limited their intervention to the destruction of empty buildings. Assadâ€™s Air Force, i.e., his preliminary method of killing civilians, was left intact.The official Israeli reaction was clear. Prime Minister Netanyahu issued a strong statement in support of the American initiative:â€œA year ago, I declared Israelâ€™s full support for President Trumpâ€™s decision to take a stand against the use and spread of chemical weapons. President Trumpâ€™s resolve and Israelâ€™s support remain unchanged. Early this morning, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom demonstrated that their commitment is not limited to proclamations of principle.â€ùHowever, Netanyahu ended his statement by saying:â€œIt should be clear to President Assad that his reckless efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, his wanton disregard for international law and his provision of a forward base for Iran and its proxies endanger Syria.â€ùNetanyahu made it completely clear that the provisioning of forward bases for Iran is what most troubles Israel. That being said, for Israel, the use of chemical weapons is exceedingly troubling. It is, however, a concern Israel has lived with ever since the first Gulf War. Back then, Israelis were supplied with gas masks in the anticipation that Saddam Husseinâ€™s missiles might carry deadly gas. In the end, Hussein did not use gas in the first Gulf Warâ€”no doubt deterred by Israelâ€™s retaliatory abilities.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowMatthew Daniels/U.S. Navy via Getty ImagesWhat Israel fears today is the entrenchment of Iranians in Syria. Iran is the one country that regularly calls for the destruction of Israel. Only last week, Iran stated that it â€œwould wipe Tel Aviv and Haifa off the map.â€ù The fear of Iranian attack went from theoretical to real, when it was announced that the Iranian UAV downed over Israel in February was armed and programmed to attack a target in Israelâ€”that drone had been sent from a base in Syria. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the control van from which the drone had been sent was destroyed. However, a week ago, Israel apparently destroyed the Iranian base responsible for sending the drone, killing a number of Iranians, including the commander of the base. The Iranians have vowed to retaliate and Israel is taking their threat seriously.The Israeli attack in Syria angered the Russians, who, for the first time, condemned Israeli actions in Syria. Netanyahu had been counting on Russian support, based on his close personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it seems Putin perceived it to be in Russiaâ€™s national interest to support Assad, while maintaining and strengthening Russiaâ€™s alliance with Iran, which it appears Putin deemed to be more important.So now, as the dust begins to clear from the American strike, it looks like little has changed strategically in Syria. Israel, while cheering the American action (it would not dare criticize the U.S.) is clearly very concerned that President Donald J. Trump will insist that the U.S. troops now in Syria return home, despite the opposition of the American National security establishment. Along with the departure of U.S. troops, whatever leverage America has in Syria will be gone, as well.As Israel prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary this week, the realization is beginning to dawn on many Israelis that while President Trump might have given Israel the symbolic gift of moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, his recent comment of â€œMission Accomplished,â€ù after he destroyed a number of empty buildings in Syria, suggests that Israel will likely have to confront Iran alone. Moreover, the Syrian people will be left in the hands of a man who chooses to rely on genocide on portions of his own people to remain in power.Marc Schulman is a multimedia historian.The views expressed in this article are the author's own."
