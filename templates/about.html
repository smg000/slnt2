                    <p id="website-text">The news today is... interesting. The line between objective fact and opinion is blurring, #fakenews is proliferating and – depending on who you talk to – toppling democracies across the world, and social media is creating "filter bubbles" that show us content that reinforces our preexisting biases. the <i>skeww</i> was designed to take a stand against the news insanity.</p>
                    <p id="website-text">The two of us founded the <i>skeww</i> while we were students at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. As news junkies who are incapable of small talk, we quickly realized that we were on opposite sides of the political spectrum, which led to many late-night, beer-fueled debates about politics and economics. Over the course of these conversations, we also realized that we were reading very different news sources with different opinions and – on occasion (ahem, ahem) – alternative facts.</p>
                    <p id="website-text">Thus, the idea for the <i>the skeww</i> was born. We believe that bias can be valuable as long as it's transparent and grounded in truth. That belief lead us to our mission: to bridge the current ideological and political divide with understanding and constructive dialoge. To make that happen, we use a use a blend of cool technologies, like natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and good 'ol fashioned human intelligence and elbow grease.</p>
                    <p id="website-text">Thank you very much for reading and sharing with us. Please <a href="/contact/">drop us a line</a> sometime to say hi, share an article, or tell us how we can improve. We're also hiring!</p>
